# DIY Keyboard
A keyboard to fit my hands... and my room

# Grand Design
## Purpose
Make a keyboard that relieves me from daily work stress... both physical and mental stresses.

For physical stress: fit my big hands and wide shoulder width. There should be no extra force to cup my hands or shrug my shoulders.

For Mental stress: fit my workspace aesthically. I'm working in a livingroom, so there should be as few pitch black objects as possible. No flashing LEDs or neon-bright colors. 

## Budget
Sky is not the limit... Keep the cost as low as a DIY keyboard kit on market.

## Time
It may take long. Lots of studies will be required. But not too much. Driking and socializing time is important too.

# Design Details
## Shape
- Split keyboard
- Ortholinear
- No protruding keys or bulky structure

The keyboard should be a split keyboard... so that there is little strain on shoulders and arms. 

Keys are to be arranged in ortholinear layout, to allow all keys to be in 1u size. This is to avoid wasting time in searching or making big keys. Shift, space, and enter keys can be laid out in 1u size. 

Also, there should be no keys that are protruding from the rectangular key layout. Special keys and frequently-used keys remain in the main two-dimensional x * y rectangular layout. No bulky, wavy alignment.

Symbols and special characters are to be arranged in En-US layout. This is the layout I'm accustomed to.

## Layout
- Frequently-used characters must be accessible with one key, without help of special keys or different layers, as much as possible.
- 5 rows... 1 row for numeric, 3 rows for alphabets and symbols, and 1 row for space key and special keys like alt, fn, and ctrl keys
- En-US symbols
