# DIY Keyboard
A keyboard to fit my hands... and my room

# Grand Design
## Purpose
Make a keyboard that relieves me from daily work stress... both physical and mental stresses.

For physical stress: fit my big hands and wide shoulder width. There should be no extra force to cup my hands or shrug my shoulders

For Mental stress: fit my workspace aesthically. I'm working in a livingroom, so there should be as few pitch black objects as possible. No flashing LEDs or neon-bright colors. 

## Budget
Sky is not the limit... Keep the cost as low as a DIY keyboard kit on market.

## Time
It may take long. Lots of studies will be required. But not too much. Driking and socializing time is important too.
